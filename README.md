# <h1>Active Directory Homelab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project will take you through the process of how to set up a basic mock active directory environment from your home desktop. We will run a PowerShell script to generate users, create virtual machines, and install DHCP servers. I recently built my first pc with I5 13th gen processor, 32GB ram, 1TB SSD M.2 storage, and a 24” LG monitor. The main purpose of building my own PC was to learn more about the fundamentals of how computers work and the terminology used when troubleshooting common issues. I hope with my passion for acquiring new knowledge about all things IT that I will grow my knowledge and someday be able to transfer that knowledge to break into the IT field.
